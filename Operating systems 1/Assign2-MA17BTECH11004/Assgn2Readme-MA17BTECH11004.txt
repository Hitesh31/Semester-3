Steps to run this programme :-

(1) Compile the Assgn2-ProcsStat-MA17BTECH11004.cpp file by running the command :-

		g++ Assgn2-ProcStat-MA17BTECH11004.cpp -lrt -o process 
	
	This will create an executable file "process".

(2) Run the "process" by executing :-
		
		./process
		for eg :   $ ./process < input.txt > output.txt
		here, input.txt is some text file containing a test case
		In input.txt, provide input as follows
		(a) first line will contain N  //This will be no. of data set values
		(b) The next N lines will contain data values

(3) The command will get executed followed by : -
	The average value is "mean"
	The standard deviation value is "standard_deviation"
	The median value is "median"
	Here, mean, standard_deviation and median are Mean , Standard Deviation and Median of the data values.

(4) Compile the Assgn2-ThStat-MA17BTECH11004.cpp file by running the command :-

		g++ Assgn2-ThStat-MA17BTECH11004.cpp -lpthread -o threads
	
	This will create an executable file "threads".

(5) Run the "threads" by executing :-
		
		./threads
		for eg :   $ ./threads < input.txt > output.txt
		here, input.txt is some text file containing a test case
		In input.txt, provide input as follows
		(a) first line will contain N  //This will be no. of data set values
		(b) The next N lines will contain data values

(6) The command will get executed followed by : -
	The average value is "mean"
	The standard deviation value is "standard_deviation"
	The median value is "median"
	Here, mean, standard_deviation and median are Mean , Standard Deviation and Median of the data values.
